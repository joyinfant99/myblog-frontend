      <h1>Hey there! 👋</h1>
      <p>I’m Joy! Originally from Chennai, but now I’m based in Munich with my wife and our little one. By day, I’m all about SaaS as a Solutions Engineer. But after hours, you’ll usually find me making music, diving into history, or hiking up a mountain</p>
      <p>I built this site (with a little AI help!) as a spot to share my projects and ideas. It’s kind of a mix of all the things I love tech, creativity, and discovery</p>
      <p>Take a look around—glad you’re here✌️</p>
