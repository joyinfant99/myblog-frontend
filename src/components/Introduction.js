      <h1>Hey there! 👋</h1>
      <p>I’m Joy, I live in Munich with my wonderful wife and our little one. By day, I work as a SaaS Solutions Engineer. 
          In my free time, I’m usually making music, diving into interesting history books, or wandering the mountains. I find a lot of joy in those moments of creativity and discovery.</p>
      <p>I’ve always been curious about technology, which led me to build this site (With the help fo AI). It’s a little project that reflects my interests and experiments with new ideas.</p>
      <p>Feel free to explore my space here, I'm excited to share my thoughts and projects with you!✌️</p>
