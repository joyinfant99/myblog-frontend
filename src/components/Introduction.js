      <h1>Hey there! 👋</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my space on the web! I'm Joy, living in Munich with my wife and lil' one, working as a Solutions Engineer at Personio. When I'm not solving problems at work, you'll catch me making beats 🎶, geeking out on history 📚, or chasing the mountain views 🏔️.</p>
      <p>Cool fact: I built this whole site from scratch using AI 🤖 Just my passion for tech and experimenting with the future 🔥</p>
      <p>Feel free to explore! This is where I drop my thoughts, projects, and notes ✌️</p>
